# Understanding Grafana Selectors 
## Key Points 
### TypeScript Source (`public/`)
- Grafana plugins, pages, and components are written in TypeScript under `public/app/plugins/...`.
- This includes all the React components, pages, and plugin logic that Playwright tests interact with. 

### Compilation Output (`dist/`)
- TypeScript source files are compiled into JavaScript files under the `dist/` folder. 
- These JS files contain the **runtime logic** that executes during Playwright tests. 

### Type Declarations (`index.d.ts`)
- The `index.d.ts` file exposes all public classes, functions, and types from the plugin-e2e package. 
- Provide **static type information** for TypeScript and IDE support. 
- Does **not** contain any implementation logic. 

### How Playwright Uses Them 
- Playwright tests import plugin-e2e components via `index.d.ts` for type checking. 
- During runtime, the imported classes/functions execute the logic from the corresponding JS files in `dist/`.

## Summary 
The `index.d.ts` file provides all importable components, classes, and types, while the `dist` JS files provide the actual runtime logic(in TS world just take generated JS files as binary executable libs). The JS files are generated by compiling the TypeScript source under `public/`. This distinction is crucial for understanding how Grafana selectors are exposed and used in Playwright tests.
